        <h5 class="card-title">Computer</h5>
        <p class="card-text">A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or
            logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow
            generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely
            wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and
            peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This
            term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a
            computer network or computer cluster.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer
            devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory
            devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal
            computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds
            of millions of other computers and their users.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple
            manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some
            mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More
            sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first
            digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor
            transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic
            integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the
            microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing
            dramatically ever since then, with MOS transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's
            law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a
            central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) microprocessor, along with
            some type of computer memory, typically MOS semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out
            arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in
            response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.),
            output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions
            (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external
            source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.</p>
